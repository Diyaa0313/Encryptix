Credit Card Fraud Detection

Introduction

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains transaction information such as transaction date, credit card number, merchant, category, amount, and whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

trans_date_trans_time: Transaction date and time

cc_num: Credit card number

merchant: Merchant name

category: Transaction category

amt: Transaction amount

first: First name of the cardholder

last: Last name of the cardholder

gender: Gender of the cardholder

street: Cardholder's street address

city: Cardholder's city

state: Cardholder's state

zip: Cardholder's zip code

lat: Latitude of the transaction

long: Longitude of the transaction

city_pop: Population of the city where the transaction took place

job: Job title of the cardholder

dob: Date of birth of the cardholder

trans_num: Transaction number

unix_time: Unix timestamp of the transaction

merch_lat: Latitude of the merchant

merch_long: Longitude of the merchant

is_fraud: Whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:


Convert categorical variables into numerical format using encoding techniques.
Handle missing values by imputing or removing them.
Scale numerical features to ensure they have the same range.
Model Selection:


Choose a suitable machine learning model for classification, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.

Model Training:


Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Train the model using the training set.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall.
Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use techniques like grid search or randomized search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

Model Deployment:

Deploy the trained model to a production environment for real-time prediction of credit card fraud.

Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX%, precision of XX%, recall of XX%, and F1-score of XX% on the test set.

Conclusion

The machine learning approach shows promise in detecting credit card fraud.
Further optimizations and feature engineering could potentially improve the model's performance.
